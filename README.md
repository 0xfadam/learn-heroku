## Why?

You know how to _create_ a web application,
but that knowledge is only _useful_
if you how to _show_ the app to people!

### Key Benefits:

+ Basic apps e.g. Demo, Hackathon or "Low Traffic" are ***Free***!!
+ Service quality is _really_ good (_under the hood Heroku uses Amazon Web Services_)
+ Excellent knowledge base / documentation for both simple and advanced topics!
+ Easily setup ***continuous deployment*** from a GitHub repository.

## What?

Easily deploy your node.js web application to Heroku
so you can start testing it with end-users as soon as possible! (5 mins!)


## Who?

_Anyone_ who values their _time_ and wants/needs
a _painless_ way to deploy a web application.

## Frequently Asked/Ansered Questions (FAQ)

### Isn't Heroku "_Expensive_" for what you're getting?

Heroku costs more per unit of computing resource than the equivalent
_infrastructure_ provider (_e.g: AWS/GoogleCloud/Azure/etc_)
but it's cheap if you factor developer's time as your biggest cost!
Setting up deployment to AWS with all the benefits/features Heroku has
out-of-the-box will take hours. So unless your developer's time is _free_
_or_ you _are_ the developer and want to spend a day on deployment
instead of building features to solve the end-user's problem,
use Heroku and focus on _building_ the product! <br />
